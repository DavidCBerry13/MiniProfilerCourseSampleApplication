<h2 class="text-danger">An error occurred while processing your request.</h2>

<h3>If this is your first time running the application...</h3>
<p>
    The error is probably due to the fact that the API project is not running.
    <ul>
        <li>In the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio, right click on the solution</li>
        <li>Then click on "Set Startup Projects..."</li>
        <li>
            Make sure that both the "Investment Manager" and "StockIndexWebService"
            projects hav an action of "Start" as shown below
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

Otherwise, take a look in your C:\temp directory at the investment-manager logs to see what might have went wrong.
